1. In the AWS Management Console, we:
    1. Type *security groups* in the search bar.
    2. Click *create security group*

1. filling the security group‚Äôs basic details

![ECS-03.png](/ECS/security%20group/ECS-03.png)

1Ô∏è‚É£ giving a security group name

2Ô∏è‚É£ giving a description for the security group 

3Ô∏è‚É£ defining in which VPC this security group resides

1. creating the Inbound rules 
    
    

‚ö†Ô∏è We will describe each part of the rule only of this rule (type , protocol , etc. ) , and for all the remaining ones we will just show the defined rule

1Ô∏è‚É£ selecting the traffic type 

üí°In our case : *HTTP traffic*  

2Ô∏è‚É£selecting the protocol

üí°In our case : ***TCP***

3Ô∏è‚É£ selecting the port range

üí°In our case : **80** 

‚ùó2Ô∏è‚É£ and 3Ô∏è‚É£ are automatically selected by the console when defining the traffic type 

4Ô∏è‚É£ selecting the source of the traffic 

‚ùóthe source of the traffic could be defined through many ways 

üí°In our case, we prefer always defining the source and destination by their respective security groups ‚áí for this rule : the source is the security group of the application Load Balancer (ALB) (which is identified by it‚Äôs security group ID as shown)

5Ô∏è‚É£ giving a description for the rule 

üí°In our case : ********************************************allowing the inbound traffic from the ALB:******************************************** which means , this rules will permit to allow all the HTTP traffic coming from the ALB (which is in reality the users traffic ) to the ECS (the tasks running on the ECS )   

1. We continue adding more rules for the remaining types of traffic that we want to permit

üí°As the arrows show : we added two other rules for : 

- **************************HTTPs traffic from the ALB**************************
- *****NFS traffic from the NFS file system*****
1. After finishing with the inbound rules , we go for the outbound rules 

![ECS-06.png](/ECS/security%20group/ECS-06.png)

üí°As the arrows show : we added rules for : 

- *******************************HTTP / HTTPs traffic to the ALB*******************************
- *****NFS traffic to the NFS file system*****
- ***MySQL/Aurora traffic to the database***

‚ö†Ô∏è The NFS file system , ALB and the RDS MySQL database will be explained in other parts. Please refer to the following pages explaining their creations  

### ALB :
